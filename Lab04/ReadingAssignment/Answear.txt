1. Question: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?

Java always passes parameter variables by value. Object variables in Java always point to the real object in the memory heap. A mutable object's value can be changed when it is passed to a method. An immutable object's value cannot be changed, even if it is passed a new value.
